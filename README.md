kit-app
=======

A simple application using DSC's Kit CMS engine to provide a complete, highly functional community web site.  In fact, the app
itself contains no functionality whatsoever; the complete CMS including WYSIWYG in place editing, forums, asset management,
etc. is all provided by the Kit Rails engine.  However this app is still useful as the fastest way to get up and running because 
most of the installation steps have been precompleted.  If you're comfortable building Rails app you're probably better off
starting with the [kit_cms gem itself](https://github.com/dsc-os/kit_cms).

Installation
------------

(These instructions assume you're using a Unix-like OS.  It should all work on Windows too, but installation might need tweaking.)

Download or clone this git repository in to an empty directory, e.g. `cms`.  Then:

    cd cms
